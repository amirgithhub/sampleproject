--Not necessarly, we are proposing a new TA-based language that is amenable to analysis. 




Complexicity: TE language that is implemented is SELinux. Firstly, consider the property. SELinux is does not satisgy these properties so it is complex. SELinux is not only TE. (TE + RBAC + constraint). prove by counter example...

constraints: I have used counter example... 




Table: one row has almost all of it , edit the overall
SELinux does provide this properties or not

formaly proved & machine checked for different tools --> Not


Xacml: not machine-checked proved---not TE

certifies---> formaly verired-bahman thesis












How table conributes:
